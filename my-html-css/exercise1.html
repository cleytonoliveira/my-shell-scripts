        <h1>The Tiger</h1>
        <p>
            Tiger Tiger, burning bright,<br>
            In the forests of the night;<br>
            What immortal hand or eye,<br>
            Could frame thy fearful symmetry?<br><br>

            In what distant deeps or skies.<br>
            Burnt the fire of thine eyes?<br>
            On what wings dare he aspire?<br>
            What the hand, dare seize the fire?<br><br>

            And what shoulder, and what art,<br>
            Could twist the sinews of thy heart?<br>
            And when thy heart began to beat,<br>
            What dread hand? and what dread feet?<br><br>

            What the hammer? what the chain,<br>
            In what furnace was thy brain?<br>
            What the anvil? what dread grasp,<br>
            Dare its deadly terrors clasp!<br><br>

            When the stars threw down their spears<br>
            And waterâ€™d heaven with their tears:<br>
            Did he smile his work to see?<br>
            Did he who made the Lamb make thee?<br><br>

            Tiger Tiger burning bright,<br>
            In the forests of the night:<br>
            What immortal hand or eye,<br>
            Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?
